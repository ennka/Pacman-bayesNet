# Pacman-bayesNet

This project is the course project of UC Berkeley, Compsci 188.
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, we design pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts.

The algorithms of the pacman agents are based on bayes net. Using models like HMM etc.
